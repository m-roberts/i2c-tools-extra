# i2c-tools-extra

This package provides `i2cping`.

`i2cping` will probe a specified I2C address on a specified I2C bus. This is similar to `i2cdetect`, but is designed to be significantly faster, to quickly determine if a peripheral device could be connected.

This package is a fork of `i2c-tools`.

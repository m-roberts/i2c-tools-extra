Description: userspace I2C programming library
 I2C devices are usually controlled by a kernel driver.  Using this
 library it is also possible to access all devices on an adapter 
 from userspace and without the knowledge of Linux kernel internals.
 .
 This package contains what you need to run programs that use this
 library.

Description: userspace I2C programming library development files
 I2C devices are usually controlled by a kernel driver.  Using this
 library it is also possible to access all devices on an adapter 
 from userspace and without the knowledge of Linux kernel internals.
 .
 This package contains what you need for compiling sources that
 use this library in your own code.

Description: Python bindings for Linux SMBus access through i2c-dev 
 This Python module allows SMBus access through the I2C /dev interface on 
 Linux hosts.  The host kernel must have I2C support, I2C device interface
 support, and a bus adapter driver.

Description: Python 3 bindings for Linux SMBus access through i2c-dev 
 This Python 3 module allows SMBus access through the I2C /dev interface on 
 Linux hosts.  The host kernel must have I2C support, I2C device interface
 support, and a bus adapter driver.
